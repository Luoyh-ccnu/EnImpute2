    abstract = "{Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables whole transcriptome profiling at single cell resolution and holds great promises in many biological and medical applications. Nevertheless, scRNA-seq often fails to capture expressed genes, leading to the prominent dropout problem. These dropouts cause many problems in down-stream analysis, such as significant increase of noises, power loss in differential expression analysis and obscuring of gene-to-gene or cell-to-cell relationship. Imputation of these dropout values can be beneficial in scRNA-seq data analysis.In this article, we model the dropout imputation problem as robust matrix decomposition. This model has minimal assumptions and allows us to develop a computational efficient imputation method called scRMD. Extensive data analysis shows that scRMD can accurately recover the dropout values and help to improve downstream analysis such as differential expression analysis and clustering analysis.The R package scRMD is available at https://github.com/XiDsLab/scRMD.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods make it possible to reveal gene expression patterns at single-cell resolution. Due to technical defects, dropout events in scRNA-seq will add noise to the gene-cell expression matrix and hinder downstream analysis. Therefore, it is important for recovering the true gene expression levels before carrying out downstream analysis.In this article, we develop an imputation method, called scTSSR, to recover gene expression for scRNA-seq. Unlike most existing methods that impute dropout events by borrowing information across only genes or cells, scTSSR simultaneously leverages information from both similar genes and similar cells using a two-side sparse self-representation model. We demonstrate that scTSSR can effectively capture the Gini coefficients of genes and gene-to-gene correlations observed in single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH). Down-sampling experiments indicate that scTSSR performs better than existing methods in recovering the true gene expression levels. We also show that scTSSR has a competitive performance in differential expression analysis, cell clustering and cell trajectory inference.The R package is available at https://github.com/Zhangxf-ccnu/scTSSR.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

As the low amount of extracted mRNA copies per cell, scRNA-seq data exhibit a large number of dropouts, which hinders the downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. We propose a statistical method, SDImpute (Single-cell RNA-seq Dropout Imputation), to implement block imputation for dropout events in scRNA-seq data. SDImpute automatically identifies the dropout events based on the gene expression levels and the variations of gene expression across similar cells and similar genes, and it implements block imputation for dropouts by utilizing gene expression unaffected by dropouts from similar cells. In the experiments, the results of the simulated datasets and real datasets suggest that SDImpute is an effective tool to recover the data and preserve the heterogeneity of gene expression across cells. Compared with the state-of-the-art imputation methods, SDImpute improves the accuracy of the downstream analysis including clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis.},

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.},
